# How rare is that Pokémon? For Pokémon Go

## Description:
When playing Pokémon Go we encounter all sorts of Pokémon. Some are much rarer than others but how can we tell? 

'How rare is that Pokémon?' lists all currently available Pokémon on the app. It explains the rarity of each Pokémon with a simple and descriptive system.

In addition, the app shows the evolution cycles for each Pokémon and explains how to hatch a certain Pokémon from an egg.

Everyone can catch a Pidgey, but can you catch a Charizard?
